now correlation matrix (heatmap), 
which is a powerful visualization in exploratory data analysis (EDA)

This correlation matrix tells you,which features are important for predicting
The direction of the relationship: Whether price goes up or down as crime rates or price like features changes

now after data ready for a machine learning model by separating features{

 Processed training features shape: (32, 20)
Processed testing features shape: (8, 20)

}

using LinearRegression() model
